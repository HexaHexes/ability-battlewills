/**
 * The Tensura RPG System menu replacement (#70, phase 2): with TRS
 * installed, its equip-skills surface opens <b>this pack's ability menu</b>
 * instead - one menu, no extra hotkey. Phase-1 evidence on #70: TRS ships
 * no API package and is built entirely on public NeoForge events, so this
 * mirrors that exact seam - {@code ScreenEvent.Opening} at
 * {@link EventPriority#LOWEST}, after TRS's own NORMAL-priority swap has
 * run (they register from their mod constructor), so both ARR's original
 * entry (their config off) and their landing screen are visible here.
 *
 * <p>The decision matches <b>class names</b>, not types: no compile
 * dependency on TRS, no vendored jar, and the whole rule is a pure
 * function the fixture pins. Without TRS the predicate is false and
 * nothing changes - the byte-identical baseline (#70's requirement 2).
 * Their shop, learning, tree and hub screens are never touched
 * (non-goals).</p>
