/**
 * The unlock gate (owner directive, 2026-11-06): <b>every ability this mod
 * registers is gated on the player having learned it in Tensura.</b> Three
 * halves, each on its natural seam:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Activation</b> - an {@link EligibilityRule} on
 *       {@link AbilityCore#ELIGIBILITY} (the hotbar's {@code CoreScopeCompat}
 *       pattern: registered at common setup, {@code appliesTo() = Set.of()}
 *       means every source) refuses {@link ActivationOutcome#REFUSED_RESTRICTED}
 *       for a tracked id the player has not learned. ARR's own
 *       {@code startHoldSkill} refuses unlearned skills too (getSkill empty
 *       -&gt; false, #52 evidence) - this rule is the uniform, explicit gate
 *       ahead of it, so refusals carry the right vocabulary no matter which
 *       consumer fired.</li>
 *   <li><b>Display</b> - {@link AvailabilityProviders#declare} per tracked
 *       id: not learned -&gt; {@code unavailable("not unlocked in Tensura")}
 *       (the bar's dim verdict); metrics stay {@code unknown} - per-ability
 *       cooldown/cost overlays are #42's overlay slice, not this gate's.</li>
 *   <li><b>Assignment/menu filtering</b> - no seam exists upstream today
 *       (the menu enumerates {@code AbilityDiscovery.entries()} unfiltered;
 *       {@code AssignAbilityPayload.handle} validates nothing per-player);
 *       filed as an ability-hotbar issue. Until it lands, assignment of an
 *       unlearned ability is possible but useless - activation refuses.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The decision core ({@link #refusalFor}) is pure and fixture-able -
 * {@code CoreScopeCompat}'s shape. The ARR read
 * ({@code SkillAPI.getSkillsFrom(player).getSkill(id)}) lives only in the
 * rule/provider bodies, so core stays upstream-free (the leak-gate rule)
 * and the pure half never loads ManasCore. Learned state is read through
 * ARR's own storage on whichever side asks (#52: client skill state is
 * synced - ARR's own screens render it client-side; in-game check pending).</p>
