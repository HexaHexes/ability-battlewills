/**
 * The hotbar half of the unlock gate (owner directive, 2026-11-06):
 * <b>unlearnt abilities are removed from the player</b> - their bar
 * assignments are cleared, persisted and echoed.
 *
 * <p><b>Soft-hook discipline (REPO.md: ability_hotbar is optional; the
 * hotbar#120 linkage lesson):</b> this class references hotbar types, so it
 * must only ever be reached from call sites <i>inside</i>
 * {@code ModList.isLoaded("ability_hotbar")} guard branches - a guarded
 * branch never links the call when hotbar is absent, and the gametest boots
 * without hotbar as the living proof. Nothing else in the gate touches it.</p>
 *
 * <p>The decision half is {@link #transform}: pure over the state record
 * (fixture-able like {@code refusalFor}), predicate-driven so the caller
 * decides what counts as unlearnt (login sweep = tracked-and-not-learned;
 * the REMOVE event = the removed id itself, whose authority is the event -
 * ARR still lists the skill mid-removal, so presence checks would lie).</p>
